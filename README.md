Components:
  - Colors: grey, red, and green
  - Windows: circle style, diamond style
  - greebles: circle, square

Features to capture:
- Uneven stacking

Other details to note:
- For each component, a given building will always have 1-3 of those elements lined up evenly on each floor. This number will not change between floors, but it will change between buildings
